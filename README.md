# AvAAntiCheat
This is an anti-cheat I made for Minecraft java servers, it works on servers that use Bukkit/Spigot API and works in minecraft version 1.21.10
the anti-cheat detects flying, chat spaming, combat logging and a few types of hacking like packet manipulation
this is a pretty basic anti-cheat.
